# Introduction

## Welcome

My son has been trying to learn how to code using AI to help teach him.  This gave me the idea to develop a course, based partially on my coding background, to teach him proper fundamentals in coding.  I have a desire to help others to learn how to code- my son, professionals at work, a high school student, and now want to teach those interested in learning how to code and program within gaming.  I have designed a course around game programming meant for beginner level coders.  This takes those with a desire and some logical thinking skills, and teaches them to think like a programmer, teaches basic coding, and then create fun games.  I chose games to introduce coding because you have to enjoy what you do and have fun doing it.  I have taken this very seriously and will provide tons of material and help the way. 

## Purpose

I'll be using this site to share information as each week is going along for students to be able to review and use the material that has been presented.
