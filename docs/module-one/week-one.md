## Practice Assignment

### Create a Game Design Document

Pick a game you know that has either little game mechanics, from the list of games on linktree, or a game you would like to create.
Create a game design document using the template below.  You can either create this on google docs, word, or even pen and paper.
The template and sample game design document should give you information on what would be included in the design document.
Please bring to next class for a reward.
