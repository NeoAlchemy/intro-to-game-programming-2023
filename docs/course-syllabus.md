# Course Syllabus

## Course Description

This course is an introduction to the fundamental concepts and tools of 2D game development with HTML5 and JavaScript. Students will learn how to design and develop 2D games using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript programming language. The course will cover topics such as game design principles, game mechanics, game development tools, and the basics of JavaScript programming

## Course Objectives

- Understand the principles of game design and mechanics, and how they apply to 2D game development
- Develop 2D games using HTML5 canvas and TypeScript
- Understand and apply basic programming concepts to game development, including loops, conditionals, and data structures
- Use external libraries and frameworks for game development, including the Phaser 3 game engine
- Understand and use collision detection and physics in game development
- Debug and troubleshoot code using developer tools

## Course Schedule

We will be going through the modules as much as we can through each week.  We will not move to the next module until they have a comfortable understanding of the current module, as each module builds upon each other.  Programming Games starts at Module 2 and will probably be week 4 after learning some bit of coding skills.  Coding starts week 2.
